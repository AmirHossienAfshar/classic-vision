# The Da Vinci Puzzle

In this computer vision challenge inspired by the mystery of a hidden message left by Leonardo da Vinci, the task is to reconstruct a lost image composed of **four encrypted fragments**. Each fragment carries a different type of visual distortion and must be recovered and combined to reveal the final hidden message.

## Fragment Descriptions

- **Fragment 1 & 2:** Represent the same content but are corrupted by **noise in different domains**. Appropriate denoising techniques must be applied.
- **Fragment 3:** Consists of **five smaller image segments** that require correct spatial alignment and reassembly.
- **Fragment 4:** Has been **color-altered** due to simulated chemical exposure and needs color correction.

The goal is to individually process the fragments, restore their contents, and align them precisely to produce a single coherent imageâ€”possibly revealing a concealed historical secret, as if solving a Renaissance-era visual cipher.
